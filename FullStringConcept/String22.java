    --> Every method is present in StringBuffer is synchronized so only one thread is allowed
       that is why in java 1.5 String Builder is come into picture.


       Only two difference between String Builder and String Buffer
       1. In place of buffer builder is used.
       2. not used synchronized keyword.

       note: every method of String Buffer is present in String builder.
